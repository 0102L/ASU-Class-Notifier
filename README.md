Installation:
* To get started, run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in your Python environment.
* To run the script, execute the command ```python notifier.py``` inside the src file.

This project is currently in development. Future additions will include:
* Email notification support
* Monitor class by section or professor
* GUI

```class_search.py``` was derived from another project located at https://github.com/remiliacn/ASU-Class-Search
